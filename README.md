# To Do Tutorial

The basic structure of this tutorial is from FSND Course 2: SQL and Database Modeling For The Web. Initial commits in 'todo_example' branch are taken directly from the tutorial, and customized changes are stored in other repositories. 

Detailed notes from the tutorial are stored here, in `todo_example` branch `README.md`; additional changes can eventually be found in main branch README.md
